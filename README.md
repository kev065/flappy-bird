# Flappy Bird

A simple **Flappy Bird** clone built using ***Dart*** and ***Flutter***. This game replicates the popular mechanics of Flappy Bird where you control a bird, avoiding obstacles (pipes) and trying to achieve the highest score possible. The game is designed to be played by tapping the screen to make the bird jump, while gravity pulls it down.

## Features

- **Gravity and Jumping Mechanism**: The bird falls due to gravity and jumps when the player taps the screen.
- **Pipes and Obstacles**: Pipes of varying heights move from right to left, providing obstacles to the bird.
- **Collision Detection**: The game detects collisions between the bird and pipes or the screen boundaries.
- **Score Tracking**: The score increases as the bird successfully passes through the pipes.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when the bird hits a pipe or falls off the screen, with a 'Game Over' message and the final score displayed.
